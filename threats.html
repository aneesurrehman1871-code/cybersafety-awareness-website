<h2>1. Phishing Attacks</h2>
<p>
<b>What is it?</b> Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by pretending to be a trustworthy source.
</p>
<p>
<b>How it works:</b> Attackers send fake emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate organizations (like banks, schools, or social media platforms) asking you to click a link or provide personal information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> An email claiming "Your account will be suspended unless you verify your password immediately" with a suspicious link.
</p>

<h2>2. Malware</h2>
<p>
<b>What is it?</b> Malware (malicious software) includes viruses, trojans, spyware, and ransomware designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.
</p>
<p>
<b>How it spreads:</b> Through infected email attachments, malicious websites, or downloading pirated software.
</p>
<p>
<b>Effects:</b> Can steal personal data, corrupt files, slow down systems, or lock you out of your own device.
</p>

<h2>3. Social Engineering</h2>
<p>
<b>What is it?</b> A manipulation technique that tricks people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.
</p>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> Someone pretending to be tech support asking for your password, or a fake friend request from someone trying to gather information about you.
</p>

<h2>4. Weak Passwords</h2>
<p>
<b>The Problem:</b> Using simple passwords like "123456", "password", or your birthdate makes it easy for hackers to gain access to your accounts.
</p>
<p>
<b>Common mistakes:</b> Using the same password for multiple accounts, sharing passwords with friends, or writing them down in visible places.
</p>

<h2>5. Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks</h2>
<p>
<b>The Risk:</b> Public Wi-Fi networks (in cafes, libraries, airports) are often unsecured, allowing hackers to intercept your data.
</p>
<p>
<b>What can be stolen:</b> Login credentials, personal messages, banking information, and browsing history.
</p>

<h2>6. Identity Theft</h2>
<p>
<b>What is it?</b> When someone steals your personal information (name, ID number, photos) to impersonate you online or commit fraud.
</p>
<p>
<b>Sources:</b> Oversharing on social media, data breaches, or falling for scams.
